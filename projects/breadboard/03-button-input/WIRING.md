# Wiring

Power off before changing a connection. Orient the ESP32 USB connector toward you and confirm board
labels; orient IC pin 1 by its notch/dot and datasheet, never by an online photo.

| Source | Destination | Colour convention | Test point |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ESP32 GPIO27 | button side A | yellow | TP1 |
| button side B | GND | black | TP2 |

Power path begins at ESP32 3V3 and returns only through ESP32 GND. Add 100 nF at each external IC.
Expected idle supply is near 3.3 V but must be measured. The mirrored-IC error swaps pin numbers and is
blocking. A missing common ground, a reversed source/destination assumption or a jumper one row away
is also wrong even when its wire colour looks correct.

not a photograph.
