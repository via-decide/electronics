# Jtag Openocd V1

Validation ID: `jtag_openocd_v1`

## Purpose

This task is part of `esp32_master_architecture_validation_v1`. It defines a production validation slice with deterministic ownership, measurable pass criteria, required hardware, and traceable source files.

## Phase

Phase 6 of the ESP32 master architecture validation stack.

## Engineering Risk

Production ESP32 systems fail when this subsystem is treated as a demonstration feature instead of a measured engineering interface. Validation must prove timing, power, memory, electrical, security, or lifecycle assumptions under realistic load.

## Source Files

`[docs/debugging.md]`

## Required Hardware

ESP32 JTAG adapter and target board.

## Test Method

Halt, inspect registers/memory, and resume execution through OpenOCD/GDB.

## Pass Metric

Debugger can halt and resume without corrupting running state.

## Failure Conditions

- Timing-critical behavior depends on blocking `delay()` or loop polling.
- ISR context performs heap allocation, filesystem access, serial printing, Wi-Fi, MQTT, or non-IRAM-safe work.
- Hardware limits are not measured or documented.
- Validation evidence cannot be reproduced from a clean checkout.
