# Esp32 Hall Diagnostic V1

Validation ID: `esp32_hall_diagnostic_v1`

## Purpose

This task is part of `esp32_master_architecture_validation_v1`. It defines a production validation slice with deterministic ownership, measurable pass criteria, required hardware, and traceable source files.

## Phase

Phase 1 of the ESP32 master architecture validation stack.

## Engineering Risk

Production ESP32 systems fail when this subsystem is treated as a demonstration feature instead of a measured engineering interface. Validation must prove timing, power, memory, electrical, security, or lifecycle assumptions under realistic load.

## Source Files

`[firmware/esp32/power_diagnostics.c]`

## Required Hardware

ESP32 board with serial monitor.

## Test Method

UART telemetry smoke test using silicon diagnostic fallback when Hall sensor is unavailable.

## Pass Metric

Diagnostic telemetry emits reset reason, boot count, and silicon status over UART or telemetry path.

## Failure Conditions

- Timing-critical behavior depends on blocking `delay()` or loop polling.
- ISR context performs heap allocation, filesystem access, serial printing, Wi-Fi, MQTT, or non-IRAM-safe work.
- Hardware limits are not measured or documented.
- Validation evidence cannot be reproduced from a clean checkout.
